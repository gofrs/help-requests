# Help Requests

One of our goals is to find projects that are relied on by the community, which
are also in need of a new maintainer. Based on the project's status and general
functionality, we can determine whether it's a project that we feel comfortable
supporting.

As part of this we'd like to make sure we're taking over projects with the help
of the previous maintainer. In cases where the project appears abandoned, we may
need to fork the project and start our own.

### Suggesting a Project

If you feel there's a project that would benefit from our help, please open an
issue above. The issue itself will have some questions that you can answer to
help us discover more about the project. From there we can begin to evaluate the
project, and our ability to properly support it.

We've also started writing a script that tries to find projects which are highly
used, but also lacking recent updates.
